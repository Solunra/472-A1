1) 	The metric best suited for the dataset that we had to calculate is the macro average F1. However, a macro average Fβ measure with a β<1 would be more appropriate.
	
	High precision helps us find articles that are classified correctly and demonstrates that articles which are wrongly identified as being relevant are few and far between.
	When searching for a certain class of documents, the search would not necessarily need to give back every document of that class, but the search should rather ensure that 
	the documents it gives back are actually of that class and are not documents wrongly identified and thus useless for the user.

	While precision is important, it must also be noted that a query on a certain type of class should return a sizeable quantity of documents. A search on a class that only returns
	2 out of 200 documents because of an overemphasis on the precision of the model would be inadequate in most use cases, thus highlighting the importance of taking recall into account.
	Given that, ideally, a search on a class returns an adequate of documents while mostly ensuring that these documents are correctly identified, a macro average 
	Fβ measure with a β<1 would take into account recall while prioritizing precision.
