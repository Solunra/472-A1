The averages of each classifier's metrics (accuracy, f1, weighted f1) are similar to the scores recorded in the first run.
Furthermore, the standard deviation of each of those values are of values are 0 or close to 0. This implies that
there are very small changes in accuracy and f1 scores between different runs.

Concerning the Naive Bayes classifier, while the standard deviation for the standard deviation for all metrics across all runs is 0 or close to 0,
The classifier itself does not perform well as can be seen through its average metrics. This means that the classifier is consistently
poor.

For both decision trees, both classifiers have a low (or 0) standard deviation for all metrics across all runs, meaning that their performance
is consistent. This performance is great, as seen in the average of metrics and in the first run.

For the Perceptron and the Base Multi-Layered Perceptron, while the average metrics are not great, they do not vary a lot between runs given the standard deviation scores.

Finally, the Top Multi-Layered Perceptron has the best average scores out of the 3 perceptrons, and its standard deviations are also low, meaning that this 
behaviour is consistent across runs.
